### Weak randomness in `MysteryBox::openBox` allows anyone to manipulate reward

## Summary
Hashing `block.timestamp` and `msg.sender` together leads to a predictable final number, making the random number generation vulnerable. This allows malicious users to manipulate or anticipate values to select specific rewards.

## Vulnerability Details
Using `block.timestamp` and `msg.sender` for randomness creates predictable outcomes. Attackers can exploit this by knowing the block timestamp or by manipulating their address to receive desirable rewards.

### Proof of Concept
There are two primary attack vectors:
1. Validators can predict `block.timestamp`, enabling them to time their participation advantageously. More information can be found in the [Solidity blog on prevrandao](https://soliditydeveloper.com/prevrandao).
2. Users can manipulate the `msg.sender` to secure the "rarest" reward.

The following function illustrates the predictability by calculating a non-zero reward based on `block.timestamp`:

```Solidity
function calculateWinTimestampValue(address addr) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 value;
    uint256 winTime = block.timestamp;
            
    do {
        winTime++;
        value = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(winTime, addr))) % 100;            
    } while (value < 95);

    return winTime;
}
```

Using on-chain values as randomness seeds is a [well-known attack vector](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-blockchain-9ced6472dbdf) in the blockchain space.

## Impact
Any user can select rewards, including the "rarest" ones, undermining the randomness of the rewards system.

## Tools Used
- VSCodium
- Slither

## Recommended Mitigation
To enhance randomness, consider using an oracle solution such as [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction) for secure and unpredictable random number generation.
