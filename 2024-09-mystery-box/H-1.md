### `MysteryBox::changeOwner` is callable by anyone allowing anyone take ownership of the contract.
## Summary
The `MysteryBox::changeOwner` function is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to take ownership of the contract. Since the contract's critical functions—setting the price of boxes, adding rewards, and withdrawing funds—are intended for the owner only, this vulnerability poses a significant risk.

## Vulnerability Details
The `changeOwner` function lacks access control, enabling unauthorized users to change the contract's ownership. 

```javascript
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    // @audit - there are no access controls here
    owner = _newOwner;
}
```

## Impact
Anyone can take ownership of the contract, granting them the ability to modify prices, add new rewards, and withdraw funds.

## Tools Used
- VSCodium
- Manual review

## Recommendations
Implement an access control modifier to the `changeOwner` function to restrict ownership changes.

```diff
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
+   require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change contract ownership.");      
    owner = _newOwner;
}
```

Additionally, update the test function in `TestMysteryBox.t.sol` to include access control checks:

```diff
function testChangeOwner_AccessControl() public {
    vm.prank(user1);
+   vm.expectRevert("Only owner can change contract ownership.");
    mysteryBox.changeOwner(user1);
-   assertEq(mysteryBox.owner(), user1);
}

+function testChangeOwner_AccessControl_Owner() public {
+   vm.prank(owner);
+   mysteryBox.changeOwner(user1);
+   assertEq(mysteryBox.owner(), user1);
}
```
